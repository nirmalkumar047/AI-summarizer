The AI Summarizer is a web-based application that uses artificial intelligence to extract key points and generate concise summaries from large bodies of text, articles, or web content. It helps users quickly grasp the essence of lengthy documents, saving time and improving productivity.

⚙️ Key Features:
🔗 URL to Summary: Paste a URL of a blog/article and get the summarized version.

📄 Text Summarization: Directly input text to get a summarized output.

🧠 AI-Powered: Uses natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models for context-aware summarization.

💾 History: Keeps a log of previously summarized URLs/text for future reference.

🧑‍💻 Modern UI: Clean and responsive design built with React + Tailwind CSS.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
